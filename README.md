Analyzing tropes from plot summaries.

Context: We find from tropes.txt that there are some typical tropes in all these movies, for example, “brainless beauty”, “arrogant kong-fu guy”, etc. We would like to explore more on how the movies shape those characters, how different characters are connected with each other, how characters help to form the plot. Are characters portrayed the same or different in different movies? Are there any patterns? How do actors usually act as those characters? Who are the most “diverse” actors?
