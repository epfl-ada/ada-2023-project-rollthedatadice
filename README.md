Welcome to the captivating world where stories unfold, emotions intertwine, and characters come to life on the silver screen! Our project sets out on a riveting journey through the heart of cinema, seeking to decode the intricate dance of characters within the vast tapestry of movie plot summaries.

In the grand tradition of narrative storytelling, characters serve as the beating heart of every cinematic masterpiece. Beyond their individual narratives, the dynamics between characters shape the essence of storytelling, steering plots towards climactic peaks, heartwarming resolutions, or tragic conclusions.

Why is understanding character dynamics so crucial? Well, as storytelling enthusiasts, filmmakers, and data enthusiasts alike, we believe that unraveling the patterns of character interactions unveils the very essence of cinematic storytelling. Characters are not mere entities; they are conduits through which narratives breathe, conveying emotions, conflicts, and resolutions.

Buckle up as we begin the odyssey through the realms of persona distributions, intricate character networks, and the pulsating rhythm of cinematic evolution! üöÄ Are you ready to peer into the soul of cinema and witness the magic that unfolds when characters take center stage? Let the curtain rise, and let the data story begin! üåü


## <a id="section_1">Understanding Individual Characters</a>
### Peering into the Essence of Characters: A Journey into Personas

This is the beginning of our cinematic exploration, where characters reveal their individuality through distinct personas. Now, let's delve into the latent behavioral and personality patterns that define characters before walking along their narrative pathways.

#### What are Personas?

In movie plot summaries, personas serve as the key to understanding the potential and latent traits of characters. These personas represent behavioral archetypes, offering a glimpse into how characters might navigate the intricacies of their cinematic worlds.

We get the personas by running the pipeline outlined in the "Learning Latent Personas of Film Characters" paper [Link](https://github.com/dbamman/ACL2013_Personas/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file).

We can take a look at the most associated words for each persona to get a basic impression.

Also, how each persona is linked to different genres:

{% include persona_genre_mapping.html %}

As we can see, persona 10 appears more in Romantic Comedy, Romance Film, Drama and Comedy; while persona 47 is more often seen in Thriller, Drama, Crime Fiction, Action.

#### Gendered Personas: Navigating Binary Essences

Our journey begins by dissecting the personas of characters based on gender. What are the most common behavioral archetypes for male and female characters?

Actually we don't really have gender information about the characters. We could only use the corresponding actor's gender instead, which might bring trivial error.
   
</details>

{% include gender_persona_percentage.html %}

We can see from the graph, the top 2 personas, 10 and 47, present a great gender discrepancy.

As the cinematic timeline unfolds, do we witness an evolution in these archetypes, reflecting changing societal norms?

What can we learn from the graph? „Äêto be added„Äë

Zooming in, we explore the nuances of personas within different genres. Does the stereotypical persona of a male or female character change when the stage is set in a romance, action, or sci-fi setting?

{% include male_genre_persona.html %}

#### Character Type Personas: Main Stage vs. Side Story

As we shift our gaze to character types, the question arises: do main and side characters typically share similar personas, or do their behavioral archetypes diverge?

{% include chartype__persona.html %}

Does it vary over time?

{% include chartype__persona_temporal.html %}

From both graphs above, it seems there's no significant difference in main and side characters' personas.

#### Closing the Curtain: A Persona-Painted Prelude

As we draw the curtain on this first part of our data story, the personas of individual characters emerge as the backdrop, setting the stage for the intricate interactions that follow. Join us in the next act as we shift our focus from individual character nuances to the dynamic dance of personas in the realm of character interactions.

###  Gendered Symphony of Character Interactions
### From Personas to Partnerships: Harmony and Discord on the Silver Screen

Having delved into the individual personas that shape the characters, we now turn our gaze towards the dynamic partnerships and interactions that unfold on the silver screen. In this chapter, we explore how the distinctive personas we unveiled in the previous act come to life in the intricate dance of gendered character interactions.

üåê Mapping the Cinematic Web:
To unravel the secrets of character interactions, we build the movie networks. Each film's plot summary transforms into a complex tapestry of relationships, woven into a network graph. Characters become nodes, and their interactions form the connecting threads. This network allows us to visualize the intricate dynamics between characters, offering a unique lens through which we decode the gendered symphony of cinematic storytelling. Here we show an example.

We use SpaCy to get the NER tags in each sentence. Then we parse each sentence to get the get Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) triples. We use only keep the triples whose subject is a character and the object is also a character. We then use the subject and object as the nodes and the verb as the edge.

  This score provides us with information about which users contribute to enriching the experience on the website, either because they rate beers that do not get much attention, or because they "introduce" new beers on the website by being the first people to rate those beers.
  
  A user $u$ is an explorer if, often enough, among the beers he rated, he/she was among the first 10 users to rate that beer. The score is, therefore: 

  $$XPL_u = \sum_{b \in B_u} \mathbb{1} [u \in U_{10}(b)]$$

  $B_u$ is the set of beers rated by user $u$.

  $U_{10}(b)$ is the set of at most 10 users that first rated the beer $b$.

  A user $u$ is an adventurer if he/she often enough risks trying out beers that have a bad rating at the time at which they rate them (less than 3.25/5, knowing that the average is at $\approx$ 3.97/5). The corresponding score is the following:

  $$ADV_u = \sum_{b \in B_u} \mathbb{1} [\overline{r}_{u,b}(t_{u,b}) < T]$$

  $B_u$ is the set of beers rated by user $u$.

  Rating $\overline{r}_b(t_{u,b})$ is the average rating of beer $b$ at the time $t_{u,b}$ at which user $u$ rates beer $b$.

  $T=3.25$ is a cut-off determined empirically based on the data.
